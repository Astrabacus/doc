The compilation of SOFA produces a binary file **runSofa**, which can be
found in the folder *%{SOFA\_BUILD\_DIR}/bin*. The execution of the
binary - either via the terminal or by double clicking the instance -
launchs a default [XML
scene](https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/write-a-scene-in-xml "Write XML scene")
with the name caduceus.

Launch SOFA
-----------

The binary **runSofa** can be launched with different options, that can
be enabled through the command line. You can display the different
options available by using the argument ‘-h’ in the command line:
`runSofa -h`
We obtain the following output:
```
This is a SOFA application. Here are the command line arguments (short name, long name, description, default value)
    -h, --help: this help 
    -a, --start: start the animation loop  (default: false ) 
    -c, --computationTimeSampling: Frequency of display of the computation time statistics, in number of animation steps. 0 means never.  (default: 0 ) 
    -g, --gui: choose the UI (batch|glut|glut-mt|qglviewer|qt)  (default:  ) 
    -l, --load: load given plugins  (default: ) 
    -n, --nb_iterations: (only batch) Number of iterations of the simulation  (default: 1000 ) 
    -p, --factory: print factory logs  (default: false ) 
    -r, --recent: load most recently opened file  (default: false ) 
    -s, --simu: select the type of simulation (bgl, dag, tree, smp)  (default: tree ) 
    -t, --temporary: the loaded scene won't appear in history of opened files  (default: false ) 
    -v, --verification: load verification data for the scene  (default:  ) others: file names`
```
When getting started with **runSofa**, the following options might be
valuable for you:

**-a:** **runSofa** starts the animation directly (no need to press on the animate button)

**-c:** Displays interesting statistics about the computation time of the simulation. It is very useful to analyse the performance of your simulation, or to benchmark a plugin developed for SOFA. The value that follows the argument determines the number of simulation steps to wait for before dumping the statistics (-c 10 will display the logs every 10 simulation steps)

**-g** allows you to choose between the existing user interfaces developed in SOFA:
**-qglviewer:** default interface
**-batch:** command line interface (only displays statistics)

**-l** allows you to load a SOFA plugin by specifying its name

**-n** specifies the number of simulation steps to run before closing **runSofa**. Can only be used with “–g batch”

### Load and run a specific scene

The default scene loaded by **runSofa** is named “caduceus.scn”. This
scene file can be found in *%{SOFA\_SOURCE\_DIR}/examples/Demos*, along
with other demo scenes. Let us see now how to load one of these scenes:

-   From the **runSofa** interface, you can select a scene file through
    the “File-&gt;Open” Menu (Ctrl+O), and run it by simply pressing the
    "animate" button.
-   If you are launching **runSofa** from the command line, you can also
    specify the scene file to load as an argument.

 

SOFA GUI
--------

To start the simulation, press "Animate" - the simulation speed in
frames per second (fps) and the advancement of the simulation time in
seconds (s) will show up in the left bottom corner. If there is a need
for a simulation with a lower or higher detail of the time, then adapt
the parameter "DT". A stepwise advancing of the simulation with the
stepsize DT can be achieved by clicking on "Step". In order to restart
the scene use "Reset Scene". The camera of the visualization on the
right hand side of the executable is controlled by the mouse movement
and the:

-   left mouse button to change the rotation of the camera
-   right mouse button to translate the camera
-   middle mouse button to zoom in and out.

The camera position and orientation can be saved and recovered using the
"Save View" and "Reset View" buttons respectively. A running simulation
can be manipulated with the mouse movement, when clicking on the left
mouse button and on shift. Further uses of the keyboard can be found in
the tab "Viewer":

-   **B:** TO CHANGE THE BACKGROUND
-   **C:** TO SWITCH INTERACTION MODE: press the KEY C. Allow or not the
    navigation with the mouse.
-   **O:** TO EXPORT TO .OBJ The generated files scene-time.obj and
    scene-time.mtl are saved in the running project directory
-   **P:** TO SAVE A SEQUENCE OF OBJ Each time the frame is updated an
    obj is exported
-   **R:** TO DRAW THE SCENE AXIS
-   **S:** TO SAVE A SCREENSHOT The captured images are saved in the
    running project directory under the name format capturexxxx.bmp
-   **T:** TO CHANGE BETWEEN A PERSPECTIVE OR AN ORTHOGRAPHIC CAMERA
-   **(Shift+) V:** TO SAVE A VIDEO Each time the frame is updated a
    screenshot is saved. The screenshots are saved in the folder
    *%{SOFA\_DIR}/share/screenshots*. If the folder does not exist, it
    needs to be created.
